Implementation of a Encoder-Decoder(UNet) Convolution Neural Network for image Upsampling

##Python Files
'UnetSuperResolution.ipynb': A notebook with Unet implementation for image upSampling or super Resolution
'UnetSuperResolution.py': The same as the last one but as a python file

##PDF
Encoder-Decoder SuperResolution.pdf: The report with the theory and how the model works
